why do I need categories in CMNS? In WordPress, categories help you organize your blog posts so that it's easier for visitors to find related content.
in CMNS = Post = blog post
In the setting writing change the default of categorized to uncategorized.
what is slug? 
A slug is the URL-friendly version of a name.
wordpress each wensite login : http://localhost:8888/myfirstwpwebsite/wp-admin
if you go to theappearance to editor : This is the new interface for site editing. 
The most important one is template : is a file that serves as a model
what template file is used to generate content ? is fundemantal of learinig templates.
URL shows which template file it is used.
if I have three categoriezed call " live - Music - dance " we would see category-live.php if it can not find it will show archive and then it would show index.php.
Once you create a post you are outputting a single post pattern in the block site editing.
header and footer are imported in all other pages, so if you change a header in dingle port your pages- your 404 and search and etc will also change accordingly.
Inner block means : keep the content you are adding aligh with the column of the main contenct not with the header of footer. 
once you add a query loop will help you to output your content dynamically.if you add a post it is going to show up there.
Try to keep your content out of the teplate, by creatibg posts and pages.
